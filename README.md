# Safe-Driver-Prediction-Insurance
Safe Driver Prediction System using Machine Learning Technique

This project presents some methods together with its justification and analysis of few experiments conducted regarding user or driversâ€™ preferences on classify whether driver is safe or unsafe and choosing car insurance package for those who drive unsafe. A set of data were used to conduct the experiments which can be found as an open source dataset at Kaggle. There are 2 platforms used to conduct the experiments, namely Jupyter Notebook where python code is used to do the analysis and modelling while the second platform is Rapidminer which is used to do some rapid process of our experiments and data exploration. All categorical values are converted into numerical form before loaded into Rapidminer and execute at Jupyter Notebook. Different results and accuracy for each experiment is obtained due to different algorithm implemented on each experiment. Therefore, data preparation and feature engineering are crucial part that need to be done before proceeding with the next following task.
